# 🚀 Railway Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your YNAB automation project to Railway with full Playwright support.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Railway Account**: Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **GitHub Repository**: Your code should be in a GitHub repository
3. **Environment Variables**: You'll need your credit card and YNAB credentials

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Connect GitHub to Railway

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign in
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your `ynab` repository
5. Railway will automatically detect the Dockerfile

### 2. Set Environment Variables

In your Railway project dashboard:

1. Go to **Variables** tab
2. Add the following environment variables:

```
CREDIT_CARD_USERNAME=your_username
CREDIT_CARD_PASSWORD=your_password
YNAB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
BUDGET_ID=your_budget_id

```

### 3. Deploy

Railway will automatically:

- Provide a public URL

## 📱 Access Your Application

Once deployed, you'll get a Railway URL like: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`

### Available Endpoints:

- **Dashboard**: `https://your-app-name.railway.app/dashboard`
- **Run Script**: `https://your-app-name.railway.app/run-script`
- **Status**: `https://your-app-name.railway.app/status`
- **Logs**: `https://your-app-name.railway.app/logs`
- **Health Check**: `https://your-app-name.railway.app/health`

## ⏰ Scheduling Options

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended) ✅

**Setup Steps:**
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Add the same environment variables as secrets:
   - `CREDIT_CARD_USERNAME`
   - `CREDIT_CARD_PASSWORD`
   - `YNAB_ACCESS_TOKEN`
   - `BUDGET_ID`
   - `BARAK_CARD`
   - `ADI_CARD`

4. The workflow will run daily at 8 AM UTC
5. You can also trigger it manually from the **Actions** tab

**Files Created:**
- `.github/workflows/daily-ynab-sync.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
- `scripts/scheduled-run.js` - Dedicated script for scheduled runs

### Option 2: Railway Cron (Alternative)

If you prefer Railway's built-in cron:

1. Create a separate Railway service using `railway-cron.json`
2. Set the same environment variables
3. Railway will run the script daily at 8 AM UTC

**Files Created:**
- `railway-cron.json` - Railway cron configuration

## 📱 iPhone Usage

1. **Bookmark the dashboard**: `https://your-app-name.railway.app/dashboard`
2. **Add to Home Screen**:
   - Open the dashboard in Safari
   - Tap the Share button
   - Select "Add to Home Screen"
3. **Run manually** anytime from your iPhone
4. **Check status and logs** from anywhere

## 🔧 Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run locally
npm run dev

# Test the full script
npm start
```

## 📊 Monitoring

### Railway Dashboard

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Playwright not working**:
   - Ensure Dockerfile includes all browser dependencies
   - Check that browsers are installed in the container

2. **Environment variables not set**:
   - Verify all required variables are set in Railway
   - Check variable names match exactly

3. **Script fails**:
   - Check logs in Railway dashboard
   - Verify credit card credentials are correct
   - Ensure YNAB API token is valid

4. **Scheduled runs not working**:
   - Check GitHub Actions secrets are set
   - Verify workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`
   - Check GitHub Actions tab for errors

### Getting Help:

1. Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
2. Check application logs: `/logs` endpoint
3. Check GitHub Actions logs in the Actions tab
